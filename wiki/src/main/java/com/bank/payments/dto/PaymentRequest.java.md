## Insights
- The use of `BigDecimal` for the `amount` field ensures precision in monetary calculations, which is critical in financial applications.
- The `type` field indicates the payment method or channel, which can be used to route or process the payment differently.
- The `idempotencyKey` is a key design feature to prevent duplicate payment processing, which is essential in distributed systems or when retrying requests.
- This class is designed purely as a data container without any validation or business logic, implying that validation and processing are handled elsewhere in the system.
