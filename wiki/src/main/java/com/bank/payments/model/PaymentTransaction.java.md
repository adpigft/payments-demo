# PaymentTransaction Data Structure Documentation

## Overview
`PaymentTransaction` is a Java class representing a payment transaction entity in a banking payment system. It is designed as a JPA entity mapped to the database table `payment_transactions`. This class primarily serves as a data structure to hold transaction details.

## Entity Mapping
| Annotation               | Description                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `@Entity`               | Marks the class as a JPA entity.              |
| `@Table(name = "payment_transactions")` | Maps the entity to the `payment_transactions` table in the database. |
| `@Id`                   | Specifies the primary key of the entity.      |
| `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` | Indicates that the primary key is auto-generated by the database. |

## Fields

| Field Name         | Type             | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | `Long`           | Unique identifier for the payment transaction (primary key).                                |
| `sourceAccount`    | `String`         | Account number or identifier from which the payment is made.                                |
| `destinationAccount` | `String`         | Account number or identifier to which the payment is sent.                                 |
| `amount`           | `BigDecimal`     | Monetary amount of the transaction.                                                        |
| `currency`         | `String`         | Currency code (e.g., USD, EUR) of the transaction amount.                                  |
| `type`             | `String`         | Type of the payment transaction (e.g., transfer, withdrawal).                              |
| `remarks`          | `String`         | Additional notes or comments related to the transaction.                                  |
| `status`           | `String`         | Current status of the transaction (e.g., pending, completed, failed).                      |
| `idempotencyKey`   | `String`         | Key used to ensure idempotency of the transaction request.                                |
| `createdAt`        | `LocalDateTime`  | Timestamp when the transaction was created.                                               |

## Accessors and Mutators
The class provides standard getter and setter methods for all fields, enabling encapsulated access and modification of the transaction data.

## Insights
- The use of `BigDecimal` for the `amount` field ensures precision in monetary calculations, which is critical in financial applications.
- The `idempotencyKey` field supports safe retry mechanisms by preventing duplicate processing of the same transaction.
- The `createdAt` timestamp allows tracking of when the transaction was initiated, useful for auditing and time-based queries.
- The class does not contain business logic; it functions purely as a data model for persistence and data transfer within the application.
