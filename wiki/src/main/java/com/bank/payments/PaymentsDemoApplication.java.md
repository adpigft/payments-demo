## Insights

- The class uses Spring Boot's auto-configuration and component scanning features through the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, simplifying application setup.
- The `main` method delegates the application startup to Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()`, which handles the lifecycle and context initialization.
- This class contains only application startup logic and no business logic or data structures.
