## Data Structures Referenced

| Class Name           | Package                  | Description                                  |

## Insights
- The interface abstracts the payment processing logic, allowing different implementations to handle payment transactions.
- The use of DTO (`PaymentRequest`) and model (`PaymentTransaction`) promotes separation of concerns between data representation and business logic.
- This interface is designed for extensibility and testability, enabling mocking or alternative implementations for different payment gateways or business rules.
